-👋 Hi, I’m @Mo-Strk
-👀 I’m interested in cars and motorcycles, but especially in Business Applications, as it’s the job I do to earn my living.
-🌱 I’m currently learning several programming languages, including Python, Java, and SQL.
-💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects, but time is not something I currently have much of.
-📫 How to reach me: This will be updated once this repository is actually in use.
-😄 Pronouns: he/him
-⚡ Fun fact: There’s a scale that measures how painful it is to be injured by different things. I wonder what the rating is for fixing code for three days straight and still not getting it to work.

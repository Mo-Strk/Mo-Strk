- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mo-Strk
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, motorcycles but especially in Business Applications as it is the job i do to earn my money.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning several different programming languages such as Python, Java and SQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several things but time is not something i currently have very much of. 
- 📫 How to reach me: This will be uptdated once this respository is actually used.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: There is a scale on how much it hurts to be injured by different things. I'm wondering what the rating is for fixing a code for three days straight and it still not working.
